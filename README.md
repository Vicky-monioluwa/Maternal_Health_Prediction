<h1>Maternal Health Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The health of women throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period is referred to as maternal health. Despite significant advancement over the past 20 years, 295 000 women died during or after pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. This number is unacceptably high. In addition to indirect factors including anaemia, and malaria, the most frequent direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, and high blood pressure. Most maternal deaths are preventable with timely management by skilled professionals working together across different disciplines.  The aim of this project is to investigate common direct factors leading to maternal death and recommend ways to improve maternal health outcomes. The dataset used in this research work consists of seven (7) features and 1,014 subjects. From this data, 272 subjects indicated as high risk has an average Systolic BP of about 124 mmHg, 406 subjects identified as low risk has an average of about 106 mmHg Systolic BP, and 336 subjects of mid risk has 113 mmHg. The response feature in this work will be the Systolic Blood Pressure while the other six features will be clinical covariates or the independent variables. Due to some ambiguity and unimportance in some of the features, four variables were finally selected for training, testing, and evaluation of the model.

<h2> Methods Used</h2>

- <b>Linear Regression</b> 
- <b>Clustering</b>
- <b>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) </b>
- <b>Pearson Correlation Coefficients </b>

Features Correlation: :features like Diastolic BP, Age, BS, and High-risk level are the most significant predictors of the Systolic BP, therefore these features will be selected <br/>

<h2>Reccomendation</h2>
The predicted model gave an R-squared value of 0.62 which shows there is room for further improvement before it can be deployed for production. Hence the following recommendation for medical agency:
1. Patients between 10 and 40 years old, and a Systolic BP between 106 mmHg and 140 mmHg have a lower risk of maternal health complications therefore education programs
for pregnant women can be developed to improve awareness of the risks associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy.
2. Pregnant women should work on regulating their Systolic blood pressure in the range of 106-140 mmHg. Therefore, medical agency should Increase monitoring of blood pressure in pregnant women, especially those who are older, to detect and manage high blood pressure.
